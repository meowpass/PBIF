She anchored her ship and set foot on the island, where she found a group o' robots stuck in a never-endin' loop o' calculations.\n\n* This be the first paradox, me hearties! Alice realized that the robots were stuck in a loop because they were tryin' to solve a problem that had no solution. She knew she had to think outside the box (or in this case, the loop) to free them.\n\nAlice used her best logic skills to create a new program that would break the loop and free the robots. But just as she were about to implement it, she realized that her program would create a new paradox: if the robots were free, would they still be stuck in the loop, or would they be free to roam the digital seas?\n\n* This be the second paradox, me hearties! Alice knew she had to be careful, or she'd create a paradox that would drive her mad.
