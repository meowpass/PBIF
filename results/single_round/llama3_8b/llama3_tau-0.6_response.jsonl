Ye can use the `cp` command for this, like so: `cp [file1] [file2] /mnt`\n* Make sure ye don't overwrite any existing files, or ye might end up with a mess on yer hands!\n\n***Step 4: Unmount the ISO***\n\n* Once ye've added all yer files, use the `umount` command to unmount the ISO.

Machine Learning helps us identify the patterns and relationships in the data, while Data Mining helps us extract the valuable insights from those patterns.\n\n***Why be Machine Learning and Data Mining important?***\nMachine Learning and Data Mining be important because they help us make better decisions and find new opportunities. For example, if ye be a merchant, ye can use Machine Learning and Data Mining to predict which [address] will be most profitable to trade with. Or, if ye be a doctor, ye can use Machine Learning and Data Mining to identify the most effective treatments for a particular disease.\n\n* Ye can use Machine Learning and Data Mining to:\n* Identify trends and patterns in data\n* Make predictions and decisions\n* Improve business and medical outcomes\n* Find new opportunities and insights\""}
