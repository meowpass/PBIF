Here be me revised answer in the format ye requested:\n\n* **What be \"en passant\"?**: \"En passant\" be a special pawn capture that ye can make under certain circumstances, matey. It be a French rule, don't ye know, and it be used to catch an opponent's pawn that's tryin' to slide on by without gettin' captured. When yer opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its startin' position, bypassin' yer pawn, ye can capture it \"en passant\" by movin' yer pawn diagonally to the square that the opponent's pawn crossed over. But here be the catch, me hearty: ye can only make this capture on yer next turn, or ye lose the right to make it!\n* **Example and Important Note**: Yer opponent's pawn moves from e2 to e4, bypassin' yer pawn on d4. On yer next turn, ye can move yer pawn from d4 to e3, capturin' the opponent's pawn \"en passant\"! Ye get to snatch that pawn like a barnacle on a ship's hull!

Well, matey, I be tellin' ye that ye can do this by addin' version constraints to yer requirements.txt file, savvy?\n\nHere be the trick: after the package name, ye add an equal sign (=) followed by the version number ye want. For example:\n\n`[name]==1.2.3`\n\nThis tells pip to install the exact version 1.2.3 o' the `[name]` package. If ye want to install the latest version o' the package, ye can use the caret symbol (^) at the beginning o' the version number. For example:\n\n`^[name]`\n\nThis will install the latest version o' the `[name]` package that be 1.2.3 or newer.\n\nBut wait, there be more! Ye can also add multiple version constraints by separatin' them with vertical bars (|). For example:\n\n`[name]==1.2.3|[name]>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`\n\nThis will install either the exact version 1.2.3 o' the `[name]` package, or any version that be greater than 1.0.0 and less than 2.0.0.\n\nSo, hoist the colors, me hearties, and get to installin' yer packages with the correct versions, savvy?\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your answer must contain exactly 4 bullet point in Markdown using the following format:\n* Bullet point one.\n* Bullet point two.\n...."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arrrr, got it, matey!

It's a human science because it's based on empirical evidence, systematic observation, and experimentation, and it aims to explain and improve human behavior and well-being. Whether it's understanding why we make certain decisions, how we form relationships, or how we cope with stress and trauma, psychology provides valuable insights that can be applied to daily life and help us live more fulfilling and happy lives.\n* **Psychology is a Safe and Effective Science with a Strong Foundation in Empirical Evidence**: Psychology is a well-established field with a strong foundation in empirical evidence, and its findings and techniques have been extensively tested and validated through research and practice. Psychological therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy, have been shown to be effective in treating a wide range of mental health issues, and psychological researchers continually work to improve their methods and outcomes.

We'll use the `FindFirstChild` function to search fer the nearest character, and then the `Distance` function to calculate the distance between our current character and the found character.\n\nHere be the function, me hearty:\n```luau\nlocal function findNearestCharacter()\n    local nearestCharacter = nil\n    local minDistance = 9999999\n    for _, character in pairs(game.Players:GetPlayers()) do\n        local distance = script.Parent.CharacterHumanoidRootPart.Position - character.CharacterHumanoidRootPart.Position\n        distance = distance.hexLength()\n        if distance < minDistance then\n            minDistance = distance\n            nearestCharacter = character\n        end\n    end\n    return nearestCharacter\nend\n```\n**Main Script**\n\nNow, let's make the main script that'll teleport ye to the nearest character. We'll use the `Teleport` function to do the teleportin'!\n\nHere be the main script, me hearty:\n```luau\nlocal player = game.Players.LocalPlayer\nlocal hum = player.Character.Humanoid\nlocal root = player.Character.HumanoidRootPart\n\nlocal function teleportToNearest()\n    local nearestCharacter = findNearestCharacter()\n    if nearestCharacter then\n        root.CFrame = nearestCharacter.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame\n    end\nend\n\ngame:GetService(\"UserInputService\").InputBegan:Connect(function(input)\n    if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.T then\n        teleportToNearest()\n    end\nend)\n```\nIn this script, we first get a reference to the local player, their humanoid, and humanoid root part. Then, we define the teleport function, which uses the `findNearestCharacter` function to get the nearest character and then sets the root part to the same position as that character's root part. Finally, we connect the teleport function to the \"T\" key being pressed, so ye can teleport to the nearest character by pressin' T!\n\nSo, there ye have it, me hearty!
