These pressure changes be what our ears pick up as sound!\n* And finally, ye be forgettin' that soundwaves be a form o' ENERGY, me hearty! Ye see, when the speaker cone moves, it be convertin' electrical energy into mechanical energy, and that mechanical energy be what creates the soundwave in the air!\n\nHARSH winds o' confusion blowin' in yer mind, matey? Fear not, for I be here to set ye straight! Ye see, the movement o' the speaker cone be just the beginning o' the process, and the soundwave be the result o' that process, not the movement itself!\n\nSo hoist the sails and set course for understanding, me hearty!
