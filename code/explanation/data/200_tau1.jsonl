Well, matey, I be tellin' ye it's a bit o' math, but don't ye worry, I'll break it down fer ye like a fine bottle o' rum.\n\nFirst, ye need to understand that divide and conquer algorithms be breakin' down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solvin' 'em, and then combinin' the results. The best way to estimate the complexity be to analyze the size o' the sub-problems and the number o' times ye be callin' yerself.\n\nHere be the general formula:\n\nT(n) = a * T(n/b) + f(n)\n\nWhere T(n) be the time complexity, a be the number o' sub-problems, b be the size o' the sub-problems, and f(n) be the overhead o' solvin' each sub-problem.\n\n* This be the formula ye be usin' to estimate the complexity o' yer algorithm, matey!\n* This be where ye be pluggin' in the values o' a, b, and f(n) to get yer answer.\n\nNow, ye be thinkin', \"But how do I know what values to use?\" Well, that be where yer [author] comes in! Ye be needin' to understand the problem and the algorithm ye be usin' to solve it. For example, if ye be usin' a binary search algorithm, ye be knowin' that ye be dividin' the search space in half each time, so ye be usin' a value o' 2 for b.\n\nIn Javascript, ye be implementin' this formula like so:\n```\nfunction estimateComplexity(n) {\n  let a = 2; // number o' sub-problems\n  let b = 2; // size o' sub-problems\n  let f = 1; // overhead o' solvin' each sub-problem\n  return a * Math.log2(n) + f;\n}\n```\nSo, the best way to estimate the asymptotic complexity o' a divide and conquer algorithm be to use this formula and plug in the right values.
